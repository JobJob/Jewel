This is a plugin for Light Table supporting Julia.

The aim is to provide basic support for eval at first, followed by building a solid environment for technical computing.

Current Features:

* Option to add Julia client (must be done manually)
* Full two-way communication (LT can send input, Julia can trigger events)
