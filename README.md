# Jewel

[![Gitter chat](https://badges.gitter.im/one-more-minute/Jewel-LT.png)](https://gitter.im/one-more-minute/Jewel) - feel free to ask questions here.

This is a Julia language plugin for Light Table, base on the [Jewel.jl](https://github.com/one-more-minute/Jewel.jl) editor backend. This plugin provides basic language support, but you should try the [Jupiter](https://github.com/one-more-minute/Jupiter-LT) plugin for a nicer set of defaults for Julia development.

Please also see the [Juno wiki](https://github.com/one-more-minute/Jupiter-LT/wiki) for documentation and installation instructions (just substitute "Jupiter" for "Juno" when searching for the plugin).
